This is a simple music record filing application built with ruby on rails. It's based on a [tutorial by Web-Crunch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUedqaHS4RQ)

# Getting Started

# Test Driven Development
This project uses Rspec for testing. To run a single test, run the following command:
`rspec spec/features/user_visists_homepage_spec.rb`
Replace the path with the path to any spec.rb file.
To run all tests, use the following command:
`rake`
